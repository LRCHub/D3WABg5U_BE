[00:23.03] You are the one
[00:25.86] Thing in my life
[00:28.15] I know I did right
[00:30.69] My brain keeps asking
[00:41.19] 
[00:33.22] Where have you gone?
[00:36.06] I know it's not wrong
[00:38.37] But my heart always knew you belonged within it
[01:01.87] 
[00:43.45] I fall asleep to hear your voice again
[00:46.26] I feel you out there with me listening
[00:48.80] To my Summer breeze, to your Autumn trees
[01:09.30] 
[00:53.77] If a solar system ain't so far away
[00:56.23] Then across the Earth is only child's play
[00:58.80] So wait for the moon and
[01:02.37] I'll be next to you
[01:11.87] 
[01:04.15] (Give up now) No way
[01:06.92] (It's too late) They say
[01:09.70] Those words get in the way, To see
[01:26.70] 
[01:14.35] Your face
[01:16.11] And your heart
[01:18.78] If the space that's between us would tear us apart
[01:24.31] I'd fly far
[01:26.46] Through the stars
[01:29.28] From Jupiter, Saturn, or Mars
[01:33.69] Wherever you are
[01:41.69] 
[01:37.17] I belong with you and you belong with me
[01:40.40] There's no guarantee
[01:42.53] So will you wait for me my baby
[01:45.51] Preparing for lift off
[01:50.41] Through light years and eons
[01:52.78] I'll find you through it all
[02:06.78] 
[01:55.00] When the comets out there keep impeding me
[01:58.15] Tell the milky find a way to clear debris
[02:00.65] If you just say my name
[02:03.25] I'll be there in a day
[02:14.25] 
[02:05.75] If the constellations luminate my life
[02:08.38] Then your love is made of stars and made up lines
[02:11.13] I'll go through
[02:13.92] All of this just to see your
[02:27.92] 
[02:16.53] Your face
[02:18.08] And your heart
[02:20.63] If the space that's between us would tear us apart
[02:25.70] I'd fly far
[02:28.32] Through the stars
[02:30.83] From Jupiter, Saturn, or Mars
[02:35.48] Wherever
[02:39.48] 
[02:36.57] You are in my heart
[02:39.05] My favorite part of
[02:41.69] A song I can't get
[02:44.23] Out of my head
[02:46.57] You are my only one
[02:49.16] My shining sun
[02:51.95] I keep orbit around
[02:55.03] Nothing can take me down
[03:07.03] 
[02:57.55] Yes it's you
[02:59.84] My light my moon
[03:02.20] My everything
[03:04.56] All I ever need baby
[03:14.56] 
[03:07.87] Travelling
[03:10.11] Through galaxies
[03:12.48] I don't need to breathe
[03:14.75] I'll do anything to see
[03:26.25] 
[03:17.11] Your face
[03:19.43] And your heart
[03:22.21] If the space that's between us would tear us apart
[03:27.47] I'd fly far
[03:29.99] Through the stars
[03:33.09] From Jupiter, Saturn, or Mars
[03:37.19] Wherever you are
[03:45.19] 
[03:44.32] Just count to ten
[03:46.43] I'll be in your arms by then
[04:00.43] 
[03:53.18] You are my constellation
[03:56.75] So please don't stop waiting for
[04:12.75] 
[03:59.34] Cause you are the one
[04:01.70] Thing in my life
[04:04.39] I know I did right
[04:08.12] Wherever you are
